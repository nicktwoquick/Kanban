# Kanban WoW Addon - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a World of Warcraft addon built using the Ace3 framework. It's a kanban-style to-do list addon that runs within the WoW game client.

## Testing Approach
- **DO NOT** attempt to run tests or execute the code directly
- **DO NOT** use `run_terminal_cmd` to test the addon
- **DO NOT** try to simulate WoW environment
- **ASK THE USER** to test the addon in-game instead

## Development Guidelines
- Focus on code quality and proper AceGUI-3.0 patterns
- Use proper frame and widget management
- Follow WoW addon best practices
- Ensure proper module structure and dependencies

## When Making Changes
1. Review the code for logical correctness
2. Check for proper AceGUI widget usage
3. Verify module dependencies are correct
4. Ask the user to test changes in-game
5. Provide clear instructions for testing

## File Structure
- `Kanban.lua` - Main addon file
- `modules/` - Individual addon modules
- `libs/` - Ace3 library dependencies
- `Kanban.toc` - Addon metadata file

## Common Patterns
- Use `AceGUI:Create()` for widgets
- Properly manage widget lifecycle with `Release()`
- Use `DoLayout()` for layout updates
- Follow the refresh pattern: remove children, re-add them

## Testing Instructions for User
When suggesting changes, always include:
- What to test in-game
- How to trigger the functionality
- What to look for to verify the change works
- Any debug output to check in chat
